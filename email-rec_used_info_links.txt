linux - "grep" offset of ascii string from binary file - Stack Overflow
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14141008/grep-offset-of-ascii-string-from-binary-file


grep --byte-offset --only-matching --text foobar filename

The --byte-offset option prints the offset of each matching line.

The --only-matching option makes it print offset for each matching instance instead of each matching line.

The --text option makes grep treat the binary file as a text file.

You can shorten it to:

grep -oba foobar filename
